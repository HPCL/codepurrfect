    "### 5.1 Function level metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of these software metrics is to evaluate the functional and space of a\n",
    "function/method of an application/class. The list and brief description of these\n",
    "software metrics is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) Cyclomatic Complexity (CC)\n",
    "\n",
    "CC is a derived, graph-based metric of function complexity, which combines the number of\n",
    "control flow graph edges (E) and the number of nodes (N) as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$CC(G)=E-N+2$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications.** High CC values are undesirable, because they can negatively impact the\n",
    "the readability of a method/function, testing difficulty and ultimate reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each project may adopt their own threshold values for CC to decide when to require\n",
    "refactoring, but some good rules of thumb thresholds are outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1-10 (Simple, low complexity) --> Good\n",
    "* 11-20 (Moderate risk) --> Bad\n",
    "* 21-50 (High Risk) --> Too complex, consider refactoring\n",
    "* \\> 50 (Not testable) –->Too complex, must be refactored\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) Fan-In\n",
    "\n",
    "Fan-in is a direct metric, which expresses the inter-module complexity of an application.\n",
    "It measures the number of functions or methods that call some other function or method.\n",
    "It is computed as a call graph-based metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications.** Fan-In is used to express how difficult it would be to replace a function or module in\n",
    "your application and how changes to a function or module can impact other functions or modules.gh\n",
    "Higher values correspond to greater amounts of effort that may be required in refactoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c) Fan-Out\n",
    "\n",
    "Fan-Out is a direct structural metric, which measures the inter-module complexity of an\n",
    "application. It computes the number of functions that are called by some function X.\n",
    "It is computed as a call graph-based metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications.**  This metric represents potential module instability\n",
    "and its ripple effect on other modules (e.g., functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d) Number of Attributes (NOA)\n",
    "\n",
    "NOA is a direct measure that describes the total number of identifiers in a\n",
    "method/function of a class/application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications.** This metrics could be used to identify the space complexity of a \n",
    "function/method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Class level metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of these software metrics is to evaluate the functional, data control and\n",
    "method call control complexities of an application. Here we include\n",
    "brief descriptions of these software quality metrics and their implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) Avg Fan-In (AFI)\n",
    "\n",
    "AFI is a derived measure. It refers to the average value of Fan-In and present the average inter-procedural complexity at application level.\n",
    "\n",
    "$AFI=\\frac{\\sum \\limits _{i=1}^{N} {Fin}_i}{N}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where N represents the number of methods/functions in a class/application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications.** Same implications as of Fan-In but this value is referring to an avergae value and can lead to identify the inter-proecedural complexity of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) Avg Fan-Out (AFO)\n",
    "\n",
    "AFO is a derived measure. It refers to the average value of Fin-Out and present the average inter-procedural complexity at application level.\n",
    "\n",
    "$AFO=\\frac{\\sum \\limits _{i=1}^{N} {Fout}_i}{N}$,   Where N present the number of methods/functions in a class/application \n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications.** Same implications as of Fanout but this value is referring to an avaergae value and can lead to identify the inter-proecedural complexity of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c) Weighted Method per Application (WMA)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a derived measure. Like WMC, which indicate a collective sum of complexity (either CC, Halsteed volum) of all methods of a class, WMA also indicate the collective sum of CC of all.\n",
    "\n",
    "$WMA= \\sum \\limits _{i=1}^{N} {CC}_i$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where N present the number of methods/functions in a class/application\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications.** WMA is propotional to the time and effort that would be required\n",
    "to develop and maintain the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example threshold values: Lower Limit = 1, Upper Limit = 50\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d) Number Of Methods (NOM)\n",
    "\n",
    "NOM is a direct measure. It describes the total number of methods/functions in a class/application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications.** NOM cannot be viewed as an indicator of the effort, but it could indicate the distribution of functionality and can indicate the existence of good method design smel\n",
    "\n",
    "Example threshold values:    Low: 4, Average : 9, High: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e) Chepin's Metric (Q)\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric describes the information strength of a method/Function. It uses for variable as follows,             a. P (input variable and an output variable),                                                                       b.

C : Control variables (such as used in conditions and loops)                                                  \n",

Like first analys, this analysis is also performed by leveraging the capabilities of libclang library. The aim of main script of this analysis is to traverse each library files (upto to define level which is by default 1 but can be change) of a target application to assess each function/method call of target application. We have summerized all types of function/method call into three groups such as 1) Inside call, 2) Outside Call, and 3) NA. For better understanding, we have presented method calls in the following diagram. The main consequences of this analysis are.   "
