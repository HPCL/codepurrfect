Wouldn't it be a good idea to *re-define* these thresholds based on the codes' analyses?\n",

Less than or equal to 5 is recommended, and the suggestion is that those methods with more than 5 parameters are painful to call, and even that they have the potential to degrade performance; add more fields and properties to classes and structs instead, they say. But is there any actual evidence for the choice of this number in modern codes, or does it just sound \"reasonable\"?\n",

For example, one research question could be: **To what extent does the calculated total amount of time it takes to develop all of a project's function accurately reflect the actual amount of time the project has been under active development?** This doesn't seem a hard question to answer since, through the use of version control data, we can subtract the amount of time the project was on a break from its total running period, and the amount calculated using halstead's metric would only correspond to the sum total of the T column in our dataset. \n",

We could then rank the different areas based on how many of their members appear in the top n-th function for a fiven metric (CC or LOC for example.) I think it would be interesting to see how these change across versions as the project matures. \n",
